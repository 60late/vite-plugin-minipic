	avif: {
		quality: 75
	},
	jpeg: {
		quality: 75
	},
	jpg: {
		quality: 75
	},
	png: {
		quality: 75
	},
	webp: {
		quality: 75
	},
	gif:{}
}
```

### convert

You can change image type by this option.  
`from` is the original image type  
`to` is the compressed image type

default:

```javascript
convert: [
	{ from: 'png', to: 'png' },
	{ from: 'jpg', to: 'jpeg' },
	{ from: 'jpeg', to: 'jpeg' },
	{ from: 'jpg', to: 'webp' },
	{ from: 'avif', to: 'avif' }
]
```

## Examples

Run examples

```
yarn vue3
```

or
