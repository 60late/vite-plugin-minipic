## ❓ Why minipic?

- 🚀 Fast compress speed  
  Based on [sharp.js](https://github.com/lovell/sharp), minipic have incredibly compresse speed.  
  Fully satisfy multi-images/big-images requirements.  
  By using minipic, compress 40m images will only cost 3 seconds. Compress ratio reach 70%~80%.

- 💾 Cache control  
  Minipic will start cache control by default. It will save images into the disk when compressing images for the first time.  
  Then next time minipic will read images info directly from disk cache to speed up compression proccess.  
  And aviod repeat compression.

- 📷 Convert image types  
  You can change image type when compressing images.
- 🔎 Include/Exclude specific image types  
  You can choose which image need to be compressed.
- 📂 Public folder support (Version≥1.1)

### sharpOptions

image compression options,the same config with sharp.js.  
For more detail config, see [sharp.js](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/api-output#jpeg).

```javascript
sharpOptions: {
	avif: {
		quality: 75
	},
	jpeg: {
		quality: 75
	},
	jpg: {
		quality: 75
	},
	png: {
		quality: 75
	},
	webp: {
		quality: 75
	},
	gif:{}
}
```

### convert

You can change image type by this option.  
`from` is the original image type  
`to` is the compressed image type

default:

```javascript
convert: [
	{ from: 'png', to: 'png' },
	{ from: 'jpg', to: 'jpeg' },
	{ from: 'jpeg', to: 'webp' },
	{ from: 'avif', to: 'avif' }
]
```

## Examples

Run examples

```
yarn vue3
```

or

```
npm run vue3
```

## Current Support image types

avif、jpeg、jpg、png、webp、gif  
more image type will be support in later version

## TODO

- [x] cache function
- [x] exclude compress file function
- [x] include compress file function
- [x] Public folder images support(version>1.1)
- [ ] Support more image types(svg……)
- [ ] Exlcude and include function in directory level.
